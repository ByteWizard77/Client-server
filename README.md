# Client-server
Establish connection between the server and client using socket programming

Description
This project focuses on establishing a secure connection between a server and a client using socket programming. The objective is to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication while transmitting information between the server and the client.

Features
Secure socket communication between the server and the client.
Encryption of data using a strong cryptographic algorithm.
Data integrity verification using cryptographic hashes.
Mutual authentication between the server and the client.
Protection against common security threats such as eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation attacks.
